# @hollware/nuxt

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [`02b2fe2`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/02b2fe2afc509bb3fb6a0f0110d1002b50953e26) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - Page views without personal data (ADR-031). `POST /events` counts a view that a page of a site sends, as the site, the path and the country, in Analytics Engine through an optional `ANALYTICS` binding; never a cookie, an IP or a user agent. The new tool `content_stats` answers the most read pages of the site over the last days, each with the published entry at its path, read from the SQL API with `HOLLWARE_ANALYTICS_ACCOUNT_ID` and the secret `HOLLWARE_ANALYTICS_TOKEN`. The MCP prompt `refresh_content` walks an agent from what readers read to an updated entry. `@hollware/nuxt` sends the views when its `beacon` option names the Hollware.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [`f17f026`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/f17f0268a90aee17c468bea37a9c1df7165c17a8) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - `@hollware/nuxt`, a Nuxt module that reads Hollware: over a service binding on Cloudflare, or over HTTP with a read token elsewhere, which stays on the server. `useHollwareEntry`, `useHollwareEntries`, `useHollwareTranslations` and `useHollwareSite` read through the site's own `/_hollware/` routes; `<HollwareContent>` renders an entry's Comark document; every page says `generator: Hollware`.

### Patch Changes

- [`1ce3486`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/1ce3486200639492118e37226d804d54da6391dd) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - `useHollwareEntries` takes `{ lazy: true }` as a third argument, and the module exports the `PageEntry` type of what a page gets.
