A new package: Hollware for any Vue 3 app that is not Nuxt. `<HollwareContent>` renders an entry's Comark document with your own Vue components, on the server and in the browser; `useHollwareEntry` and `useHollwareEntries` read published content from a browser-only app (a Vite SPA) over HTTP with a read token, through `createHollwarePlugin`. `@hollware/client` now holds the server helpers that `@hollware/react` had, `createHollware`, `previewRedirect`, `previewHeaders`, `previewCookieClear` and `isPreviewRequest`, so React and Vue share them; `@hollware/react` still exports every one.
