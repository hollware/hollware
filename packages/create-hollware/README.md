# create-hollware

Creates a new project for [Hollware](https://hollware.com), an open-source headless CMS for the
agent era, native to Cloudflare Workers.

```sh
npm create hollware@rc my-cms
pnpm create hollware@rc my-cms --pm pnpm
```

It copies the starter into `my-cms`, pins every Hollware package at its own version, runs
`git init` and the install, applies the migrations to the local database, and makes your site,
its owner and a first personal token. Then it prints the token once, a link to set up your passkey
for the admin, and the `claude mcp add` line that connects Claude Code to it.
