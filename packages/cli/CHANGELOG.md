## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- [`069c95f`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/069c95f1e940ea4f9ac013cac3a69d5ad5d7732d) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - An activity log of who did what (ADR-037). Every operation that is not a read, every change of tokens, people and invitations in the admin, sign-in and sign-out, an invitation accepted, an app allowed or revoked, and each scheduled publication write a line: who did it as Hollware verified it (a person, a token, an app, or the deployment), what the client declared apart, the action, its target and its outcome, refusals of a scope included. The log is append-only in D1 (migration `0016_audit_log`). Owners read it on the admin's Activity page and download it as CSV.

  The owner decides what it keeps, in the site's `audit`: `ipAddresses` is `off` by default (`hashed` keeps an HMAC of each address keyed by the site, never the address), and `retentionDays` is `null` by default (forever), or 30 to 3650 days. `hollware init` and `npm create hollware` take `--ip-addresses` and `--audit-retention-days`.

- [`3893d8e`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/3893d8e6b2d66ceb429cc24dbad51a5a2191dd89) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - A token's expiry is the person's choice: `hollware token create` and the admin's Tokens page make a token that never expires when no days are given, and one that expires in the days given (1 to 365) otherwise. Revoking it ends it at once.

### Patch Changes

- [`5e24d98`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/5e24d987c38466a315bcb3b94c3dfa23de90e71f) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - Security fixes from the threat model:

  - `verifyWebhook` takes `isNew(eventId)`. Given it, a webhook replayed within the tolerance is refused, by the id of its signed body (T-67).
  - The renderer reads a URL bound to the frontmatter (`:href="frontmatter.url"`) under its own rules instead of leaving it to `@comark/html`, which let a `data:image/svg+xml` link through (T-59).
  - An invitation link carries its secret in the fragment (`/setup#invitation=…`), which no request log holds. Older links still work (T-55).
  - Sign-in requires user verification explicitly. A counter that went back, or an assertion from another origin, is a refused passkey, not a server error (T-52, T-53).
  - The admin shows the preview of a draft in a sandboxed frame. Nothing it renders can run, reach the admin or draw over it (T-60).

### Minor Changes

- [`2d70e42`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/2d70e428142983d3859dbc68450dfa9510baabc2) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - `hollware export <directory>` writes the entries of a site over MCP as `<collection>/<locale>/<slug>.md`, byte for byte as Hollware keeps them, so that `hollware import` takes them back unchanged, with `--published`, `--collection`, `--locale`, `--site` and `--dry-run`.

- [`2d70e42`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/2d70e428142983d3859dbc68450dfa9510baabc2) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - `hollware import --from nuxt-content` moves a Nuxt Content site to Hollware: the pages of its `content/` routed as Nuxt Content routes them, their Markdown kept, a `title` from their first heading when they have none, and with `--locale-dirs` their locale from the first folder and their translations tied in a group.

### Minor Changes

- [`eaa743d`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/eaa743d4f6a6cb7ec5977f73379e6f414f43403f) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - A new project has no `hollware.config.ts` (ADR-033): the starter's Worker is `createHollware()`, and `hollware init` gives the site its first definition from a preset, `--preset blog|docs|empty` (blog by default) in `--locales` (en by default), which `create-hollware` takes too and hands to it. A project that still has a config keeps it: `init` writes no definition there, and the Worker moves the config into the database on its first request. The presets live in `@hollware/core` (`sitePreset`, `collectionPreset`), shared by the CLI and the admin. The fixes Hollware gives point at the admin and the operations instead of a config file.

- [`286149b`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/286149b7106adb84b5ee02b0433dc780b50be6e3) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - Webhooks need no Worker secret of their own (ADR-033): one that names none is signed with a secret Hollware makes with the new operation `make_webhook_secret`, answers once, and keeps sealed in D1 (migration `0012_site_secrets`) under `HOLLWARE_SECRET`, which `hollware deploy` now makes when the Worker has none. The admin's Site adds and removes webhooks and makes their secrets. A site in the trash keeps its rows until it is restored.

### Patch Changes

- [`03df44d`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/03df44d3ff8a24a3b285645f137cd973ff9e1b9c) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - The agents fit the Workers free plan: Hollware's cron wakes them every ten minutes over an `AGENTS` service binding to their `run` entrypoint, so they need no cron trigger of their own (five per account), and each run is one agent in turn, within the fifty calls a free run may make (the translator reads each locale in one listing, the reviewer takes eight reviews a run, the auditor checks a dozen entries a run and writes its report from them once a week). Their requests carry the Host of Hollware's public URL, which a service binding does not set. `hollware migrate --remote` takes a Time Travel bookmark of a database D1 cannot export, as any database with the full-text index of 0.5 is, instead of stopping.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [`2b76bb0`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/2b76bb01979986c7f9ec8bb2b2080bad7c252fcd) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - `npm create hollware <dir>` makes a project: the starter, every Hollware package at its own version, `git init`, the install, the local migrations, and the site with its owner and a first token, then the `claude mcp add` line for it. `hollware deploy` deploys to Cloudflare, creating the D1 database, the KV namespace and the queues on the first run and setting the public URL of the Worker, and migrates the remote database. `hollware doctor` checks a project and says what to fix. `hollware migrate --remote` takes no backup of a database that has none of the migrations yet.

- [`43333d3`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/43333d309843e464c47b20412d2d1d05738c835a) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - A deployment serves every site of its config (ADR-027). A personal token, an OAuth grant and an RPC call each act on the one site they name; a person has one passkey and one session for the deployment, with a role per site. The consent page asks which site when the person is in several, the admin switches sites (`GET /v1/admin/me`), and `hollware init --site <key>` on a database with an owner adds the site to that owner. Migration `0006_people_across_sites.sql` drops `site_id` from passkeys, sessions and sign-in challenges.

- [`a7b5f26`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/a7b5f261d08bf8b58e3dc98ee0a7148de71d394b) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - Read tokens and CORS for the read API (ADR-028). A read token (`hw_read_`) reads the published content of one site over `GET /v1/…` and is refused everywhere else; make one with `hollware token create --read` or in the admin. A site lists the origins of its pages in `cors.origins`, and those pages may read it from the browser. Migration `0007_read_tokens.sql` adds the `kind` of a token.

### Patch Changes

- [`6109c83`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/6109c832f1a789d856f8c5af13674b92aff08606) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - `hollware import --publish` with a token without `content:publish` asks for a review of each entry: the server refuses a group from it, and the import then sends each entry on its own.
- Updated dependencies [[`43333d3`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/43333d309843e464c47b20412d2d1d05738c835a), [`a7b5f26`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/a7b5f261d08bf8b58e3dc98ee0a7148de71d394b)]:

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [`88b921f`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/88b921fac97aca124cadbe171d4d422d4e318e93) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - `hollware import --publish` publishes what it imported as one group (in groups of 100), so entries that link to each other are published together; an entry that stops the group is reported and left out, and the rest is published. The CLI also reads wrangler's JSON past a warning printed before it, which made `hollware init` lose its token. `publish` with a group names the entry that has a warning to acknowledge in `failedEntry`.

- [`736214b`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/736214b5f8656113a5f52f46e96c328da4ab819e) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - Passkeys, invitations and sessions for the admin. The server adds migration `0004_identity.sql` and the `/setup` and `/signin` pages; a person's role in a site is their row of the new `members` table, `owner`, `editor` or `author` (every person with a token becomes a member of its site, a `reviewer` of v0.2 an `author`). `hollware init` prints the owner's link to set up a passkey, and `hollware invite --role editor|author` invites a person.

- [`ee1786b`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/ee1786be92bf76ff3ef7583763eb4400070dd096) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - `hollware invite --owner` prints a setup link for the owner of the site, to set up a passkey: on a deployment made before the admin existed, or on a new device.

- [`777ce1d`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/777ce1dee559ffa13ad576ab2f60d485097f104b) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - Reviews. `publish` needs `content:write`: without `content:publish` it runs the same checks and answers `pending_review`, and a person who may publish answers with the new operations `approve_review`, which publishes the revision in their name, or `request_changes`, with a note; `list_reviews` lists them. A new revision of the entry cancels its pending review. The server adds migration `0005_reviews.sql`. `hollware import --publish` reports `pending_review` for an entry that a token without `content:publish` asked to publish. A schedule made through OAuth now publishes as that client.

- [`1660281`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/1660281f9ea7e048060c4f65801caff9f92ba29a) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - v0.1, the core: an agent writes and publishes Markdown over MCP, contracts check every write, and a site reads what is published over a service binding.

  - `@hollware/core`: the config (`defineConfig`, `defineCollection`, `defineComponent`), the contracts and their opt-in factories, the nine operation specs and the Markdown pipeline on Comark.
  - `@hollware/server`: `createHollware(config)`, the Worker with the MCP endpoint behind personal tokens and the read-only `Hollware` entrypoint for sites, and the D1 migrations.
  - `hollware`: the CLI's `init`, `migrate`, `token` and `import`.

- [`d834e1e`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/d834e1e6cff6d04795842f0d847af64067f104af) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - Releases now ship from the `release` branch and are published directly from CI with provenance, after the maintainer approves the `npm` environment (ADR-015). The packages themselves are unchanged.

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- [`622b862`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/622b8621227246aec6425471de2b257516cea3e0) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - First release: the package skeletons. Nothing is usable yet; this release proves the publishing pipeline end to end.
