Daily backups of each site to R2: after 03:00 UTC the cron writes `backups/<site>/<date>.json` to the bucket `MEDIA`, with the definition of the site and every entry, its latest Markdown and the published one, and keeps 30 days. `list_backups` (MCP and the admin's Site page) lists them, `GET /v1/backups/<date>` downloads one with `schema:admin`, and `hollware backup list` and `hollware backup get <date> <dir> [--published]` turn one back into the files `hollware import` reads.
