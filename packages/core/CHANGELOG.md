# @hollware/core

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`705aabf`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/705aabf95c83ef7ddb2b2c0b2b633a25f03dabe4) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - Publication events (ADR-025): a publish or an unpublish writes its event to an outbox in the same batch, and the Worker delivers it from a Queue (its new `queue` handler) or, without one, from the cron trigger: to the webhooks of the site, signed with HMAC-SHA256 (`signWebhook` and `verifyWebhook` in `@hollware/core`), and to IndexNow. Each subscriber gets each event once; a failure is retried and ends in the dead-letter queue. A site declares its `url` and its `events` in the config.

- [`24faa62`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/24faa62acd99f961885adb76fe05813df1d9adcb) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - `publish` takes a `group` of other entries to publish in the same step, all or none (ADR-024): links between the entries of the group count as published, so entries that link to each other can be published together, and a refusal names the entry that stopped the group in `failedEntry`.

- [`58b2bb1`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/58b2bb135ab37f295c4043331f914ba2d3bd78f8) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - `publish` takes `publishAt` to schedule a publication (ADR-025): the entry is checked now and waits as `scheduled`, and the Worker's new `scheduled` handler, run by a cron trigger every minute, publishes it at its time in the name of who scheduled it. A change after scheduling, or `unpublish`, takes it back to a draft. The migration `0003_events_and_schedules.sql` adds the tables of schedules and of the outbox of v0.2.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [`1660281`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/1660281f9ea7e048060c4f65801caff9f92ba29a) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - v0.1, the core: an agent writes and publishes Markdown over MCP, contracts check every write, and a site reads what is published over a service binding.

  - `@hollware/core`: the config (`defineConfig`, `defineCollection`, `defineComponent`), the contracts and their opt-in factories, the nine operation specs and the Markdown pipeline on Comark.
  - `@hollware/server`: `createHollware(config)`, the Worker with the MCP endpoint behind personal tokens and the read-only `Hollware` entrypoint for sites, and the D1 migrations.
  - `hollware`: the CLI's `init`, `migrate`, `token` and `import`.

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- [`d834e1e`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/d834e1e6cff6d04795842f0d847af64067f104af) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - Releases now ship from the `release` branch and are published directly from CI with provenance, after the maintainer approves the `npm` environment (ADR-015). The packages themselves are unchanged.

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- [`622b862`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/622b8621227246aec6425471de2b257516cea3e0) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - First release: the package skeletons. Nothing is usable yet; this release proves the publishing pipeline end to end.
