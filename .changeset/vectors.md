Vectors as derived data (ADR-030). A Worker with an `AI` (Workers AI) and a `VECTORIZE` binding embeds every published entry, one vector for its summary and one for each section (`chunksOf` in `@hollware/core`), and keeps them in line with what is published: an internal `vectors` subscriber follows each publish and unpublish, and the cron trigger indexes what no event did, such as entries published before the bindings were added. Migration `0009_embeddings.sql` records which revision, model and chunker each entry's vectors come from. A Worker without those bindings is unchanged.
