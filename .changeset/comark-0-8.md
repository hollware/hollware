Comark 0.8.1, with its fixes for URLs, markup and nested props. The documents of the shared fixtures come out the same, byte for byte, as with 0.7.0, and the cron reparses the revisions that 0.7.0 parsed. Two things change. A code block renders its language as `data-language` on the `<pre>`. And as Comark keeps 49 levels of nesting and drops the text below them, a document that nests elements more than 49 levels deep is refused with its fix, where 100 was the limit, so no word is lost quietly.
