A new project has no `hollware.config.ts` (ADR-033): the starter's Worker is `createHollware()`, and `hollware init` gives the site its first definition from a preset, `--preset blog|docs|empty` (blog by default) in `--locales` (en by default), which `create-hollware` takes too and hands to it. A project that still has a config keeps it: `init` writes no definition there, and the Worker moves the config into the database on its first request. The presets live in `@hollware/core` (`sitePreset`, `collectionPreset`), shared by the CLI and the admin. The fixes Hollware gives point at the admin and the operations instead of a config file.
