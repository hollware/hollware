The agents fit the Workers free plan: Hollware's cron wakes them every ten minutes over an `AGENTS` service binding to their `run` entrypoint, so they need no cron trigger of their own (five per account), and each run is one agent in turn, within the fifty calls a free run may make (the translator reads each locale in one listing, the reviewer takes eight reviews a run, the auditor checks a dozen entries a run and writes its report from them once a week). Their requests carry the Host of Hollware's public URL, which a service binding does not set. `hollware migrate --remote` takes a Time Travel bookmark of a database D1 cannot export, as any database with the full-text index of 0.5 is, instead of stopping.
