### Patch Changes

- [#24](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/pull/24) [`73110f5`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/73110f5317dd9da454ad45a84baccedd1403767a) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - An upload that opens on an XML declaration and many comments no longer stalls the check of its format, and a URL or a path with thousands of trailing slashes no longer takes seconds to trim: both are read in linear time.

- [#24](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/pull/24) [`73110f5`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/73110f5317dd9da454ad45a84baccedd1403767a) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - The packages carry no comments but the TSDoc of their public API, and the help of the CLI and the descriptions of the MCP tools no longer cite decision records the repository does not have. The starter's `AGENTS.md` now says what each setting of its `wrangler.jsonc` is for.

- [`88965e8`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/88965e8b3431656e939056cc8cfb7ec0b4206072) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - Components to render entries in every framework:

  - `<HollwareImage>` in React, Vue and Nuxt renders the image a frontmatter field holds (a cover) with its alt, its size and the `srcset` of its copies; `imageOf(entry, field)` of `@hollware/client` gives the same attributes for any other renderer. The `images` of a summary carry the alt of each image.
  - `@hollware/astro` exports `HollwareContent.astro`, which renders an entry from its document with the site's own Astro components (`components={{ callout: Callout }}`), through the same rules as the HTML Hollware makes, and `HollwareImage.astro`. Its loaders keep the document and the images of each entry for them.
  - `safeDocument` of `@hollware/core` copies a document through the rules of `renderHtml`, for a renderer of a site's own.

## 1.0.0-rc.3

### Minor Changes

- [`e4b8296`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/e4b8296ac4f525f5ee969f2bcd1cb466b06be3e4) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - `createHollware` (and so `@hollware/react` and `@hollware/vue`) reads `search` and `describeSite` too, as the binding and the read API already did: a site's search page needs no reader of its own.

- [`0150c9f`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/0150c9f4d1be3be699d6987946acd3bc5041e619) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - An entry can change its slug: `move_entry` (MCP) and "Change URL" in the admin give it another path and keep its revisions and translations. An entry that was ever published keeps its old slug as a redirect, which `list_redirects`, the RPC method `listRedirects`, `GET /v1/redirects`, `createHollware().redirectFor()` and the admin's Site page answer, so a site serves the old path with a 301; `hollware export --published` writes them to `redirects.json`. Moving a published entry takes content:publish and purges its pages.

- [`cebe6bb`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/cebe6bb99e776214d595f6223744b3fa670dd8ea) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - Entries can refer to entries of another collection: the rule `reference` of the catalog (a field, a collection, and optionally a locale) checks that each slug a field names exists when writing, and is published to publish. `get_entry` with `references: true` (MCP, RPC, `?references=true`, and `createHollware().getEntry(…, { references: true })`) answers the published entries each field names, in its order: an author, a series, the event of a talk.

- [`5e4bee1`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/5e4bee1adf9d2e119b90ca4ae3c5e07d8055c260) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - Responsive images: when an image is uploaded, Hollware also makes its narrower copies, the `media.widths` of the site (640 and 1280 pixels by default, `[]` for none), served at `<url>/<width>`. `upload_asset`, `get_asset` and `list_assets` answer `widths` and `srcset`; the HTML of `get_entry`, and the document a site reads, give each image its `srcset`, `sizes`, `width` and `height`; and a summary read by a site (`get_entry`, `list_entries`, `createHollware()`) carries `images`, the size and `srcset` of each image its frontmatter names, by URL, to lay out a cover. The admin sets the format, quality, widest width and copies in Site, and shows the copies of each image. Images uploaded before keep none.

- [`102ea18`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/102ea18cbc076fbc47f1128b0f71e98e4dd071d8) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - `search` answers, with `passages: true`, the passage each result matched: the whole section of the entry, its heading, and the URL of the entry on the site, what a model reads to answer with your content and cite it (RAG). `minScore` leaves out what matches by meaning less, so a question nothing answers finds nothing. Over MCP, RPC, the read API (`?passages=true&minScore=0.5`) and `createHollware`.

### Patch Changes

- [`ea570be`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/ea570be69416f9a9b87d6d3a449975a42a58ab48) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - A preview read on a Hollware without `HOLLWARE_SECRET` is refused as `invalid_preview`, like any refused preview link, so a site drops its preview cookie and shows the published page instead of an error.

- [`1310c51`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/1310c515a6ee07656aac57f3d5cd0fa0e824dd83) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - The READMEs on npm say what each package is and how it is used, instead of "pre-alpha, not usable yet"; the CLI's lists `dev` and `mcp-config`.

- [`865c6c7`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/865c6c75ebd68f3c30993a0f9f346c9188f7843f) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - `verifyWebhook` answers false for an empty secret instead of throwing, and the exchange of a preview link always redirects to a path of the site: a link whose path starts with `//` or `/\` no longer sends the browser to another host.

- [`51fc47c`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/51fc47c170d39ce69350c800d287309ba3ebb92e) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - `@hollware/client/webhooks` (and `@hollware/core/webhooks`): `verifyWebhook`, `signWebhook` and the header names, with no zod and no other import. A site whose own zod is another major, such as a Nuxt Content site on zod 3, checks Hollware's webhooks through it: the root entry evaluates every schema of Hollware with the site's zod, and fails at load.

### Minor Changes

- [`304e18d`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/304e18d68482c88db6987e2453bcfa0b75467595) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - A person in the admin opens the latest revision of an entry, a draft included, on the real site before it is published. "Preview on the site" makes a signed link of one hour for that entry (`hw_prv_…`, `POST /v1/admin/preview`, `preview.create` in the activity log), and `getEntry` takes it as `preview` over the RPC binding, the read API (`?preview=`) and `@hollware/client`; a token that does not hold is an error, never the published version. The token is in the URL once: `@hollware/nuxt` and the new `hollwarePreview()` middleware of `@hollware/astro` answer the link with a `303` to the same URL without `?hollware-preview=` and keep the token in the `hollware_preview` cookie (HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax, one hour, Secure but on localhost), `useHollwareEntry` and the live loader (`getLiveEntry('blog', { id, preview })`) read it from there, a token Hollware refuses as expired or invalid clears the cookie, and a previewed page is never cached. `@hollware/client` exports the pure parts. It needs the Worker secret `HOLLWARE_SECRET`.

- [`5e24d98`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/5e24d987c38466a315bcb3b94c3dfa23de90e71f) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - Security fixes from the threat model:

  - `verifyWebhook` takes `isNew(eventId)`. Given it, a webhook replayed within the tolerance is refused, by the id of its signed body (T-67).
  - The renderer reads a URL bound to the frontmatter (`:href="frontmatter.url"`) under its own rules instead of leaving it to `@comark/html`, which let a `data:image/svg+xml` link through (T-59).
  - An invitation link carries its secret in the fragment (`/setup#invitation=…`), which no request log holds. Older links still work (T-55).
  - Sign-in requires user verification explicitly. A counter that went back, or an assertion from another origin, is a refused passkey, not a server error (T-52, T-53).
  - The admin shows the preview of a draft in a sandboxed frame. Nothing it renders can run, reach the admin or draw over it (T-60).

- [`302cbf6`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/302cbf6e70012513b6debb63fc3b818f97136ee9) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - A new package: Hollware for any Vue 3 app that is not Nuxt. `<HollwareContent>` renders an entry's Comark document with your own Vue components, on the server and in the browser; `useHollwareEntry` and `useHollwareEntries` read published content from a browser-only app (a Vite SPA) over HTTP with a read token, through `createHollwarePlugin`. `@hollware/client` now holds the server helpers that `@hollware/react` had, `createHollware`, `previewRedirect`, `previewHeaders`, `previewCookieClear` and `isPreviewRequest`, so React and Vue share them; `@hollware/react` still exports every one.

The operation `search` finds the published entries that hold every word of a query, in their title, tags and text, best first, with a snippet that marks the match; it is a tool over MCP, `GET /v1/search` in the read API, and `search` over RPC and in `@hollware/client`. Migration `0008_search.sql` adds the FTS5 index, kept by triggers in the step that publishes or unpublishes, and indexes what is published already. "migracion" finds "migración".

- [`310b3ab`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/310b3abbadfe303be1c90e4c5009ef99bc08c8e1) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - Semantic and hybrid search (ADR-030). `search` takes a `mode`: `fulltext`, `semantic` (by meaning, in any language) or `hybrid`, the default, which merges both; the answer says which mode ran, and a Worker without semantic search answers full text. `get_entry` takes `related: true` and answers the published entries closest to the entry by meaning, in its collection and locale. Over RPC and `@hollware/client` they are the options `mode` and `related`; over the read API, `GET /v1/search?mode=` and `GET /v1/{collection}/{locale}/{slug}?related=true`.
