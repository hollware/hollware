# create-hollware

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- [`eaa743d`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/eaa743d4f6a6cb7ec5977f73379e6f414f43403f) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - A new project has no `hollware.config.ts` (ADR-033): the starter's Worker is `createHollware()`, and `hollware init` gives the site its first definition from a preset, `--preset blog|docs|empty` (blog by default) in `--locales` (en by default), which `create-hollware` takes too and hands to it. A project that still has a config keeps it: `init` writes no definition there, and the Worker moves the config into the database on its first request. The presets live in `@hollware/core` (`sitePreset`, `collectionPreset`), shared by the CLI and the admin. The fixes Hollware gives point at the admin and the operations instead of a config file.

### Minor Changes

- [`2b76bb0`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/2b76bb01979986c7f9ec8bb2b2080bad7c252fcd) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - `npm create hollware <dir>` makes a project: the starter, every Hollware package at its own version, `git init`, the install, the local migrations, and the site with its owner and a first token, then the `claude mcp add` line for it. `hollware deploy` deploys to Cloudflare, creating the D1 database, the KV namespace and the queues on the first run and setting the public URL of the Worker, and migrates the remote database. `hollware doctor` checks a project and says what to fix. `hollware migrate --remote` takes no backup of a database that has none of the migrations yet.

### Patch Changes

- [`92ccc02`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/92ccc02ce181db4f291f543a109cd2bd3bf0d7d1) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - A project installs with npm, whose peer check refused Vite+'s core in place of `vite` (the starter now overrides every `vite` with its own), and with pnpm, which refused the build scripts of esbuild and workerd (a pnpm project gets a `pnpm-workspace.yaml` that allows them). A step that fails shows the last 30 lines of what it printed.

### Patch Changes

- [`d834e1e`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/d834e1e6cff6d04795842f0d847af64067f104af) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - Releases now ship from the `release` branch and are published directly from CI with provenance, after the maintainer approves the `npm` environment (ADR-015). The packages themselves are unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- [`622b862`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/622b8621227246aec6425471de2b257516cea3e0) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - First release: the package skeletons. Nothing is usable yet; this release proves the publishing pipeline end to end.
