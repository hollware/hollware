# @hollware/nuxt

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#85](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/pull/85) [`5934bf8`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/5934bf84b1202d8b558c185e71e41312dabcc400) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - A collection may declare `navigation: { groupBy, groups, orderBy }`: a string or enum field that groups its entries, the groups in order (an enum's own order when none are given), and a number field that orders each group before the title. `getNavigation(site, collection, { locale })` answers the published entries of a locale arranged that way, with their title, description, path and order, over RPC, `GET /v1/:collection/navigation` and the client (`HollwareReader.getNavigation`, `createHollware().getNavigation`). A collection without one is a single group by title; more than 1,000 published entries in the locale are refused. The `docs` preset groups by `section` and orders by `order`. `@hollware/nuxt` adds `useHollwareNavigation` and `/_hollware/navigation/:collection`, `@hollware/vue` `useHollwareNavigation`, and `@hollware/astro` `hollwareNavigation`.

### Patch Changes

- [`299bd70`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/299bd7073ebff9e3c1d7701de0d702973eb6ee8f) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - With `cache: 'purge'`, a change marks its pages stale instead of deleting them, and the edge serves the last good copy of a page while the Worker fails to render it again (`stale-if-error`).

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- [`0647944`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/06479447b92e584277b0be96162888039e198adb) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - Hollware no longer counts page views: a site connects the analytics it already has, and `content_stats` reads them. Connect Cloudflare Web Analytics, PostHog, Plausible or GA4 in the admin (Site, Analytics), with `hollware analytics connect <provider> --credential-file <file>`, or with the new tool `connect_analytics`; the read-only key is tested before it is kept, sealed under `HOLLWARE_SECRET`, and never shown again (`get_analytics`, `disconnect_analytics`).

  To upgrade: remove `beacon` from `hollware` in `nuxt.config`; remove the `analytics_engine_datasets` binding `ANALYTICS` and the variables `HOLLWARE_ANALYTICS_ACCOUNT_ID` and `HOLLWARE_ANALYTICS_DATASET` from the Worker's `wrangler.jsonc`, and delete its secret `HOLLWARE_ANALYTICS_TOKEN` (`wrangler secret delete HOLLWARE_ANALYTICS_TOKEN`); then connect the site's analytics. `POST /events` is gone, and `@hollware/server` no longer exports `AnalyticsWriter` and `PageView`.

- [#73](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/pull/73) [`42df9fb`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/42df9fb82477bec5b80385bd1b853f68d89092db) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - The public API of 1.0 loses 54 values that nothing outside their own package used and no page of the docs names: constants, defaults and helpers internal to how Hollware works. Every type stays, as the names of what remains. Code that imported one of them takes the value from what uses it, or asks for it in an issue:

  - `@hollware/agents`: `AGENTS_CLIENT`, `ALLOWED_TOOLS`, `AUDIT_STATE`, `auditDue`, `capped`, `DailyLimitReached`, `DEFAULT_MODEL`, `kvMemory`, `LAST_AUDIT`, `reportOf`, `ROLES`, `slugOf`, `workersAiModel`

  - `create-hollware`: `USAGE`

### Minor Changes

- [`88965e8`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/88965e8b3431656e939056cc8cfb7ec0b4206072) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - Components to render entries in every framework:

  - `<HollwareImage>` in React, Vue and Nuxt renders the image a frontmatter field holds (a cover) with its alt, its size and the `srcset` of its copies; `imageOf(entry, field)` of `@hollware/client` gives the same attributes for any other renderer. The `images` of a summary carry the alt of each image.
  - `@hollware/astro` exports `HollwareContent.astro`, which renders an entry from its document with the site's own Astro components (`components={{ callout: Callout }}`), through the same rules as the HTML Hollware makes, and `HollwareImage.astro`. Its loaders keep the document and the images of each entry for them.
  - `safeDocument` of `@hollware/core` copies a document through the rules of `renderHtml`, for a renderer of a site's own.

### Patch Changes

- [#55](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/pull/55) [`77b98b8`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/77b98b8e91e34b6b11c70adb16ed5fe35efda837) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - Comark 0.8.1, with its fixes for URLs, markup and nested props. The documents of the shared fixtures come out the same, byte for byte, as with 0.7.0, and the cron reparses the revisions that 0.7.0 parsed. Two things change. A code block renders its language as `data-language` on the `<pre>`. And as Comark keeps 49 levels of nesting and drops the text below them, a document that nests elements more than 49 levels deep is refused with its fix, where 100 was the limit, so no word is lost quietly.

- [`8b8b51f`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/8b8b51fd057b945b826c2c1a67b3193a713f7483) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - Hardening: the reply to a publish question counts only for the entry the call publishes; a webhook secret sealed by 0.8 to 0.10 is sealed again to its site and name when it is read; and the webhook route of `@hollware/nuxt` purges only for events of its own site.

- [#24](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/pull/24) [`73110f5`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/73110f5317dd9da454ad45a84baccedd1403767a) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - The packages carry no comments but the TSDoc of their public API, and the help of the CLI and the descriptions of the MCP tools no longer cite decision records the repository does not have. The starter's `AGENTS.md` now says what each setting of its `wrangler.jsonc` is for.

- [`406b6f2`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/406b6f2076de30a0ee92670f0ca598029cb13a5c) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - The entries of a Nuxt page carry their `images`, so `<HollwareImage>` gets the size, alt and `srcset` of a cover.

- [`88965e8`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/88965e8b3431656e939056cc8cfb7ec0b4206072) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - Components to render entries in every framework:

  - `<HollwareImage>` in React, Vue and Nuxt renders the image a frontmatter field holds (a cover) with its alt, its size and the `srcset` of its copies; `imageOf(entry, field)` of `@hollware/client` gives the same attributes for any other renderer. The `images` of a summary carry the alt of each image.
  - `@hollware/astro` exports `HollwareContent.astro`, which renders an entry from its document with the site's own Astro components (`components={{ callout: Callout }}`), through the same rules as the HTML Hollware makes, and `HollwareImage.astro`. Its loaders keep the document and the images of each entry for them.
  - `safeDocument` of `@hollware/core` copies a document through the rules of `renderHtml`, for a renderer of a site's own.

### Patch Changes

- [`406b6f2`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/406b6f2076de30a0ee92670f0ca598029cb13a5c) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - The entries of a Nuxt page carry their `images`, so `<HollwareImage>` gets the size, alt and `srcset` of a cover.

### Minor Changes

- [`304e18d`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/304e18d68482c88db6987e2453bcfa0b75467595) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - A person in the admin opens the latest revision of an entry, a draft included, on the real site before it is published. "Preview on the site" makes a signed link of one hour for that entry (`hw_prv_…`, `POST /v1/admin/preview`, `preview.create` in the activity log), and `getEntry` takes it as `preview` over the RPC binding, the read API (`?preview=`) and `@hollware/client`; a token that does not hold is an error, never the published version. The token is in the URL once: `@hollware/nuxt` and the new `hollwarePreview()` middleware of `@hollware/astro` answer the link with a `303` to the same URL without `?hollware-preview=` and keep the token in the `hollware_preview` cookie (HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax, one hour, Secure but on localhost), `useHollwareEntry` and the live loader (`getLiveEntry('blog', { id, preview })`) read it from there, a token Hollware refuses as expired or invalid clears the cookie, and a previewed page is never cached. `@hollware/client` exports the pure parts. It needs the Worker secret `HOLLWARE_SECRET`.

- [`fb9c085`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/fb9c085fa4246142f5ba0f7f6f595f77f09241b1) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - `hollware.cache: 'purge'` keeps the pages that read Hollware in Cloudflare's Workers Cache, which serves them without running the Worker, each tagged with what it showed (the tags of `@hollware/core`, recorded by the composables and by every read of `useHollware` on the server). Hollware's webhook to `POST /_hollware/webhook`, checked with `NUXT_HOLLWARE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, purges the tags of what changed, so a publish, an edit or an unpublish shows in seconds everywhere. Errors, writes and responses that read nothing are never kept, and the browser keeps nothing. It needs `"cache": { "enabled": true }` in the site's wrangler.jsonc. `cache: <seconds>` still keeps pages with Nitro's `swr`.

### Minor Changes

- [`aa2c244`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/aa2c244d80bc2e392c11bbcbe52572068ccb4fd1) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - The option `cache` keeps a rendered page for that many seconds and serves it again while a fresh one renders in the background (Nitro's `swr`), so that most requests render nothing: on the Workers free plan, a server-rendered page can cost more than the 10 ms of CPU a request has. Errors and the `/_hollware/` routes are never kept.

The new tool `content_stats` answers the most read pages of the site over the last days, each with the published entry at its path, read from the SQL API with `HOLLWARE_ANALYTICS_ACCOUNT_ID` and the secret `HOLLWARE_ANALYTICS_TOKEN`. The MCP prompt `refresh_content` walks an agent from what readers read to an updated entry. `@hollware/nuxt` sends the views when its `beacon` option names the Hollware.

- [`1ce3486`](https://github.com/hollware/hollware/commit/1ce3486200639492118e37226d804d54da6391dd) Thanks [@sergioazoc](https://github.com/sergioazoc)! - `useHollwareEntries` takes `{ lazy: true }` as a third argument, and the module exports the `PageEntry` type of what a page gets.
