Reviews. `publish` needs `content:write`: without `content:publish` it runs the same checks and answers `pending_review`, and a person who may publish answers with the new operations `approve_review`, which publishes the revision in their name, or `request_changes`, with a note; `list_reviews` lists them. A new revision of the entry cancels its pending review. The server adds migration `0005_reviews.sql`. `hollware import --publish` reports `pending_review` for an entry that a token without `content:publish` asked to publish. A schedule made through OAuth now publishes as that client.
