Webhooks need no Worker secret of their own (ADR-033): one that names none is signed with a secret Hollware makes with the new operation `make_webhook_secret`, answers once, and keeps sealed in D1 (migration `0012_site_secrets`) under `HOLLWARE_SECRET`, which `hollware deploy` now makes when the Worker has none. The admin's Site adds and removes webhooks and makes their secrets. A site in the trash keeps its rows until it is restored.
