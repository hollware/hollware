A deployment serves every site of its config (ADR-027). A personal token, an OAuth grant and an RPC call each act on the one site they name; a person has one passkey and one session for the deployment, with a role per site. The consent page asks which site when the person is in several, the admin switches sites (`GET /v1/admin/me`), and `hollware init --site <key>` on a database with an owner adds the site to that owner. Migration `0006_people_across_sites.sql` drops `site_id` from passkeys, sessions and sign-in challenges.
