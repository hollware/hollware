Page views without personal data (ADR-031). `POST /events` counts a view that a page of a site sends, as the site, the path and the country, in Analytics Engine through an optional `ANALYTICS` binding; never a cookie, an IP or a user agent. The new tool `content_stats` answers the most read pages of the site over the last days, each with the published entry at its path, read from the SQL API with `HOLLWARE_ANALYTICS_ACCOUNT_ID` and the secret `HOLLWARE_ANALYTICS_TOKEN`. The MCP prompt `refresh_content` walks an agent from what readers read to an updated entry. `@hollware/nuxt` sends the views when its `beacon` option names the Hollware.
