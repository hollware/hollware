Images. `upload_asset` takes a JPEG, PNG, WebP, AVIF, GIF or SVG, judged by its bytes, and converts it once by the site's new `media` setting (WebP at 85 by default, PNG lossless, GIF with its frames, nothing wider than 2400 px; or AVIF, or the file as it came). An SVG is kept as it is, and refused when anything in it can run. R2 keeps the image and its original; content shows it as `img: asset:ast_…` or `![alt](asset:ast_…)`, which reads of the published site and HTML turn into the URL where the Worker serves it, cached for a year. `list_assets` and `get_asset` read them; the admin has an Images page; `hollware export --assets <dir> --assets-url <path>` writes the images for a site that serves them itself, and without it keeps the originals in `_assets/`, which `hollware import` uploads again under the same ids. A new project binds an R2 bucket (`MEDIA`), which the first deploy creates, and the Images binding (`IMAGES`); `hollware doctor` says when either is missing. Migration 0017 adds the `assets` table.
